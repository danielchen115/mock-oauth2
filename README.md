# mock-oauth2
A self-contained, framework-agnostic OAuth 2 mock server to develop and test authorization without worrying about authentication. Spin up permissions logic and token handling without commiting to the dependencies and complexities of a third party auth server.


An excuse to learn Go and MongoDB.
